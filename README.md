## React Standards
#### In spreading state and props attributes
If you will be using the state and props attributes more than once, it would be a good idea to spread the attributes to make things much more easier to type. Be wary of conflicting attributes names though.

This only works in the `render` function. It will not work if you have the error exception on a different function. Also, only works if the component is the parent of the component that raised the error.
